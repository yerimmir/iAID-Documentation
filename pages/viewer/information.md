<h2>User Preference</h2>
Keyboard remapping lets you associate a sequence of keystrokes with a particular action, so that typing the sequence of keystrokes causes the action to occur. The sequence of keystrokes can be either a single key or a single key combined with Shift, Ctrl, or Alt. The action can be to display a character, to execute a host function, to execute a custom function, or to execute a menu command.

Click the function you want to change and press the new key

If you want to restore the default key, Click Reset to Default.
