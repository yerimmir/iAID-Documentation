### Details

Link Tool has three options.

#### Slice Position

Navigation linking groups by image plane, therefore images of different orientations will navigate separately from other orientations. Also, images without a plane will be linked under a separate linking group. If a linked series stack does not have a slice close to the navigating series location then a broken link will be displayed.

#### Zoom & Pan

Zoom and pan linking group images by orientation and treat images of other orientations as a separate group. The position of pan is in fractional coordinates therefore images of different sizes may be zoomed and panned within the same group.

#### Window Setting

Window level linking will group series by modality and localizer type. Therefore only images of a specific modality will be window leveled together.
